This repository contains the source code and media for my personal website.


The `main` branch is the production site, deployed at [jdecroocq.github.io](https://jdecroocq.github.io/).\
The other branches are used temporarily before being merged into the `main` branch. Development branches (`X.Y.Z`) are short-lived branches created to develop and test upcoming features, while `content` branches are sometimes used to modify non-code content and verify it. These test branches are deployed to addresses that are not publicly accessible.<br><br>
